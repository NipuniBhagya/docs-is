# Configure Adaptive Authentication for an Application

This page guides you through setting up [adaptive authentication](insertlink) for an application. 

-----

This guide assumes you have your own application. If you wish to try out this flow with a sample application, click the button below.

!!! note
    The following scenarios are available as samples.

     - Role-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - User Age-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - Tenant-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - User Store-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - IP-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - Device-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - Login Attempts-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - ACR-Based Adaptive Authentication
     - Adaptive Authentication Using Function Library

## Customizing the authentication script

1. Modify the template accordingly if required on the script editor.

2. Click **Update** to save changes. 

If required, you can also use the script editor to introduce new functions and fields to an authentication script based on your requirement, and then engage the script to the service providerâ€™s authentication step configuration. 

A sample authentication script is shown below 

```java
var onLoginRequest = function(context) {
    // Some possible initializations...
    executeStep(1, {
        onSuccess: function (context) {
            // Logic to execute if step 1 succeeded
            executeStep(2, {
                onSuccess: function (context){
                    // Logic to execute if step 2 succeeded
                },
                onFail: function (context){
                    // Logic to execute if step 2 failed
                }
            });
        }
        onFail: function(context){
            // Logic to execute if step 1 failed
            executeStep(3);
        }
    });
}

function someCommonFunction(context) {
    // Do some common things
}
```
